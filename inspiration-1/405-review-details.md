I tried to open the repo you linked, but I can’t access it from this environment (the web tool can’t load that GitHub URL). If you can make it public (or share a ZIP/tarball here), I can do a line-by-line review with concrete file paths and diffs.

In the meantime—so you’re not blocked—here’s a focused, repo-oriented audit plan you can run immediately. It targets the exact weak spots I flagged earlier (transactions, monitoring, and validation) and will surface inconsistencies quickly.

Quick triage (10–15 mins)

Run these greps at the repo root and skim the hits:

# 1) Transaction semantics & consumer isolation
rg -n "isolation.level|read_committed|read_uncommitted|enable.idempotence|transactional.id|commitTransaction|abortTransaction"

# 2) Any confusion of LSO vs HW
rg -n "Last Stable Offset|LSO|High Watermark|HW|endOffsets|watermark"

# 3) Admin/Coordinator usage
rg -n "AdminClient|listTransactions|describeTransactions|abortTransaction|KafkaAdminClient|Transaction.*Coordinator"

# 4) Metrics & cardinality risks
rg -n "prometheus|micrometer|meter|counter|histogram|summary|labels|tag\\(|label\\(|.withTag|.label\\("

# 5) State machine & event correlation
rg -n "tentative|state( |_)?machine|reconcile|timeout|window|dedup|idempotent|out-of-order|reorder|sequence"

# 6) Tests simulating open/aborted txns and LSO stalls
rg -n "Test.*Transaction|open transaction|abort|read_committed|exactly-once|EOS"

Red flags to watch for when you inspect those hits:
	•	Any consumer doing validation/“ground truth” with read_uncommitted (that’s fine for monitoring) but then comparing its progress to HW instead of LSO. Validation should be relative to LSO.
	•	Any code or docs that equate HW with LSO. They’re not the same, and it will skew lag metrics and “not seeing messages” diagnoses.
	•	Admin polling without backoff/jitter or without a way to filter by transactional.id pattern.
	•	Metrics that create labels from transaction IDs or user IDs → unbounded cardinality.

Targeted code checks (what to fix or confirm)
	1.	Validator consumer must be read_committed and LSO-aware
	•	Confirm config: isolation.level=read_committed.
	•	Wherever you measure “lag” for the validator, ensure it’s computed vs LSO, not HW. If you’re using client endOffsets, make sure they reflect read_committed behavior for the validator client and not global HW.
	2.	Rename and clarify “Transactional Watermarks”
	•	In code and metrics, avoid “watermark” unless you mean Kafka’s offset watermarks. Prefer OpenTxMaxTimestamp and ClosedTxMinTimestamp (or similar). Document which clock you use (event time vs append time vs processing time), and keep it consistent.
	3.	Coordinator polling hygiene
	•	If you have a CoordinatorCollector:
	•	Add configurable poll interval (default 10–30s), exponential backoff on failures, and jitter.
	•	Support transactional.id regex or prefix filters.
	•	Record self-metrics: request duration, error counts, throttling, permission denials.
	•	Graceful degradation in read-only environments (managed clouds): no abort attempts unless explicitly enabled.
	4.	State machine for multi-topic transactions
	•	Make “tentative close” rules explicit and test them:
	•	Don’t flip to tentative_closed on the first “close” you see unless all expected steps for the same transaction version are observed within window W.
	•	Handle re-ordering and retries idempotently (e.g., by (transactional.id, sequence/epoch)).
	•	Provide a reconciliation path that can revert tentative_closed if late steps arrive.
	5.	Metric cardinality & windows
	•	No per-transaction labels.
	•	Use histograms/counters with bounded label sets (topic, partition, app, environment).
	•	Choose windows (e.g., 1m/5m/1h rollups) and clearly document aggregation. Add exemplars/sampling instead of labeling every transaction.
	6.	Validation harness must include broker truth
	•	Extend tests to capture:
	•	LSO progress (not HW), alongside validator consumption offsets.
	•	Counts of committed vs aborted transactions per topic/partition in the same time window.
	•	Add chaos cases: open but not closing, aborted after partial writes, producer epoch rollovers.
	7.	Security & ACLs
	•	If aborting transactions is supported, document required ACLs and provide a strict “read-only” mode. Fail closed with a clear message when permissions are missing.

Suggested unit/integration tests to add
	•	LSO stall test: Start a transaction, write to a partition, never commit—assert validator stops at LSO while monitor continues, and your dashboard reports “LSO stalled” with a bounded metric.
	•	Cross-partition transaction: Write a transaction across N partitions; delay one partition’s writes; verify you don’t mark the transaction closed early and that your reconciliation logic finalizes correctly.
	•	Aborted transaction visibility: Produce and abort; assert monitor saw records but validator never does; metrics show aborted_transactions_total increment and your state machine ends at verified_aborted.
	•	Coordinator backpressure: Simulate coordinator unavailability; ensure poller backs off and self-metrics report degraded mode without flooding logs.

Paper/doc fixes you can apply now
	•	Replace all “High Watermark (LSO)” phrasing with: “LSO is the consumer-visible boundary for read_committed; HW is the replication boundary. Validator lag and correctness must be measured vs LSO.” Update any figures that depict progress accordingly.
	•	Rename “Transactional Watermarks” to avoid conflation with Kafka’s offset watermarks. Clarify which timestamps and clocks you use.
	•	Add a section on sampling & permissions for the coordinator collector, including expected overhead, poll intervals, and behavior in restricted environments.
	•	Include a baseline comparison (Kafka CLI/KIP-664 tools, Confluent Control Center, KMinion) and show a case your system catches that the baseline misses—ideally with numbers and screenshots.

If you share the code

If you can upload a ZIP/tarball here (or make the repo public), I’ll:
	•	Point to exact files (e.g., consumers, admin/poller, metrics exporter, tests).
	•	Propose concrete diffs (config changes, method refactors, metric names).
	•	Add a small suite of failing tests that demonstrate the current gaps, plus fixes to make them pass.

Until then, the grep checklist above will surface the main issues quickly, and the test matrix gives you an immediate path to harden both the code and the paper.
